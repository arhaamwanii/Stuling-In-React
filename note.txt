what in the living FUCK
    - so basically these three months were plain waste
    - at the beginning i had come to a point where i knew react exactly as much as i knew rn : which changed nothing during that time
    - studying also did not change
    
Fuck my friends what they do what there opnions are to stand out you have to stand out 
    - if you focus on two things you will end up achieving nothing 
    - jack of all shades is a master of none 

well if you want to make content you will have to add in voice 
    - there is a clear defereatiator in between STUDY WITH ME and the actual youtube brand building conent -- 
    - i would clearly need to make a new channel for that beacuse i would have to switch the audience

you can build a lot of shit using the right api's
    you don't have to do everything from scratch
    you need to have right poeple aroudn you so that you can deligate

only so much of a start ups you have to make decisions and you have to make them right - small need peedy things don't matter while doning a startup - for that we need a lot of thigs to go in a very particular order to make it work you don't need to speak fast you can speak slow

here is the thing -- when you are building a startups and then you are trying to make something basically what you are tryign to do is it to solve a problim both on macro and micro scale - so yeah you don't have to learn abosultely everything to go and build a product you need to know the bare minimum and then go ahead - bare minium and then learn at an top speed during the proccess

how much do i need to learn before going ahead and start building innt
    - like interms of material:
        :these are the materials i have to finish to go ahead start building
        :i have to pre choose the resources i want to go with

with the type of content i am producting right now i have to target the study with me audience even tho it dosen't matter but why not try to earn money out of it but you know it still dosen't matter so here is the thing you make the whole thing
here is the question? who is going to consume the type of content i am producting, the focus self improvement audiece prbably wont so i will have to switch to the kind of audience i had before then make a new channel for the new content
